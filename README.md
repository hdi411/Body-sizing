# Body Sizing Program

## Overview
Our Body Sizing Program is a revolutionary solution for online shoppers, allowing them to find the perfect clothing size quickly and accurately with just two simple photos. By taking a photo from the front and a photo from the side, the system can instantly extract key body measurements such as bust, waist, and hips. These measurements are then compared to the productâ€™s size chart, providing users with a recommended size that is most likely to fit them. This eliminates the guesswork, helping users make better, more confident shopping decisions.

The system works seamlessly as an additional feature within shopping platforms, giving users the advantage of personalized size suggestions without requiring them to manually input their body measurements. Inspired by popular e-commerce platforms, such as Amazon, this tool enhances the online shopping experience by integrating easily into existing retail websites and apps.
